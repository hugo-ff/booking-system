# A very simple booking system

### The task 📋

_We would like you to create a very simple booking system, please see the attached screenshots._

_The first screen has a dynamic list of grades that has to be fetched remotely, the user can choose one or multiple days and a time range. Clicking on "Create Bookings" will take the user to the second screen._

_The second screen shows a list of bookings to be created based on the date and times selected in the previous screen and staff available for each booking._

1. The list of grades must be fetched remotely from https://static.healthforcego.com/grades.json

2. Clicking on "Create bookings" on the first screen should retrieve a list of available staff but for this task you will generate them randomly.

3. Clicking on "Confirm bookings" on the second screen should post the data to a server, but for this task you will print to console.log the data.
